# Enable wifi if it was disabled 
sudo rfkill unblock wifi

# Write wireless SASID and pre-shared key to wpa_supplicant.conf file in one command 
sudo sh -C "wpa_passphrase 'TestWifi' 'TestPassword' >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf 

# Use wpa_cli t reconfigure/reload the wireless settings
sudo wpa -i wlan0 reconfigure

  GNU nano 5.4                                                           /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
  
  
-----------------
Set active wifi from command line. To do this initially you need

    a) labtop
    b) small wifi router that is paired with rasberry pi, always providing local LAN and therefore
       keyboard, mouse and monitor access to rasberry pi via ssh.

Configure well-known router to be priority=1, meaning that no matter what other netweorks are available
if the router is plugged in and functioning you can access the rasberry pi through a labtop. Here's
how you do it. In the example below "TP-Link_3AA3" is the wifi that is paired with rasberri pi to
always provide, keyboard mount and monitor access

    sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

        ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
        update_config=1
        country=GB

        network={
                ssid="Galaxy Jay"
                psk="Rn220kll"
                key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        }
        network={
                ssid="WT hotspot 1a"
                psk="westtisbury"
                key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        }
        network={
                ssid="TP-Link_3AA3"
                psk="20626303"
                key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
                priority=1
        }
        network={
                ssid="OakbluffsLIB"
                key_mgmt=NONE
        }


=======================
How to show rasberry pi currently active wifi name 

Open the Raspberry Pi command line
Use the iwgetid utility
Run the following command to return the network name, or SSID, the Wi-Fi network that your Pi is connected to:

    iwgetid

iwgetid is similar to the iwconfig utility you may have used before, except that its output is easier to parse.


==========================
How to list all available on rasberry pi

    (iwlist wlan0 scanning) | grep ESSID


=========================
Run DataServer as a Daemon

    sudo cat /etc/crontab

        # Add the following line to /etc/crontab
        @reboot jay1860 python <Root path to NinjaNIRS_ClientServerTCP>/main.py server
